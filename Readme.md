# Welcome Rockstar ðŸ˜Ž !
If you made it here, you most likely applied for the role of a junior typescript engineer [ignite.dev](ignite.dev)

Now here is a task for you to crack


 We use [adonisjs](adonisjs) here at ignite.dev

## Task description
You'll be building a single backend api endpoint that leverages uses [github app ](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/apps?apiVersion=2022-11-28) to get private repositories from your github repository.

To complete this task 
1. You are expected to create and configure a github app
2. Use the `credentials` from the `github app` to write an api endpoint using adonisjs that returns private repostiories in your github account.
3. Submit the link to your github repo [here](https://forms.gle/MbzdjS6mhTih9gdy5)


Good luck !
